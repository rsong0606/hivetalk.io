                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What is your company going to make?</h3>
                        <p>We're developing a language learning application that prioritizes interactive chatting and real-world practice. Within our app, users will enjoy immersive and tailored English learning journeys, featuring a dictionary, chatbot-driven conversation practice, visual aids, testing capabilities, simulated real-life scenarios for practice, and image-based English learning resources. Users have the option to engage in both text and audio chats with our bot. We'll capture all chat history to customize and enhance their learning journey for a more personalized experience.</p>

                        <h3>Which group of people are your customers? What problems do you solve for your customers?</h3>
                        <p>Our primary customers are students and non-native English speakers who are seeking to improve their language skills. This includes individuals ranging from beginners to advanced learners who need practical and tailored English language practice.</p>
                        <p>We solve several key problems for our customers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> Traditional language learning methods often fail to address the real-life language needs of learners. Our AI-powered app provides interactive and context-based learning, making it easier for users to apply their language skills in daily situations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personalized Learning:</strong> Many language learners struggle with generic learning materials that do not cater to their specific needs. Our app uses advanced AI to offer personalized learning experiences, adjusting to each user's proficiency level and learning pace.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Practice Opportunities:</strong> Non-native speakers often lack sufficient opportunities to practice their English in a conversational context. Our app's chatbot feature enables users to engage in both text and audio chats, simulating real-life conversations and enhancing their speaking and listening skills.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility and Cost:</strong> Language learning can be expensive and sometimes inaccessible. Our freemium model ensures that users can access essential learning tools for free, with the option to upgrade for more advanced features at an affordable cost.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?</h3>
                        <p>Having grappled with the challenges of learning English as non-native speakers, we've experienced firsthand the hurdles and frustrations that come with using the language. However, when we stumbled upon generative AI, it dawned on us that this could revolutionize how we learn languages. Song has domain knowledge of big language models through his current job as a data scientist. Its capability to provide customized responses to our questions presents a golden opportunity for personalized learning experiences. In traditional learning, the emphasis often lies on providing a standard answer. However, we believe that language learning's essence lies in recognizing its flexibility, acknowledging that there isn't a single correct response, and understanding its adaptation to real-life usage.</p>
                        <p>We've conducted various interviews with friends and family members, each with differing levels of English proficiency. Their English needs vary significantly; for instance, my parents prioritize practical scenarios applicable to their daily lives over memorizing vocabulary. Meanwhile, our friends who have lived in the States for many years require assistance in developing advanced presentation skills for their work. Therefore, we would like to use this AI-driven approach to build a useful tool that can fulfill these needs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?</h3>
                        <p>What sets us apart is that our app isn't just about chatbots; we offer a complete language toolkit designed for everyday use. This includes interactive real-world scenarios, multi-modal learning options, and personalized learning paths tailored to individual user needs.</p>
                        <p>We understand that effective language learning requires contextual and practical application, which we integrate into our app to make learning more relevant and engaging.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, large corporations often struggle to adapt quickly due to their size, while our agility as a smaller company allows us to rapidly respond to user feedback and implement cutting-edge features. This flexibility enables us to continually enhance the user experience in ways larger competitors may not be able to.</p>
                        <p>Our primary focus is on leveraging these unique advantages to provide a more personalized, practical, and accessible language learning experience.</p>

                        <h3>What's your business model? How much revenue per year can you achieve in 5 years?</h3>
                        <p>Our business model revolves around a freemium subscription service. Users can access most modules (chatbot, real-world scenario training) for free with limited attempts, while advanced features (AI-driven personalization) and additional attempts come with a monthly or annual subscription fee. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with educational institutions for bulk licensing deals and explore in-app purchases for specialized learning packs, ensuring diverse revenue streams and scalability.</p>
